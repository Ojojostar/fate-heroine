Hello and welcome to my first project of all time!!! (dated 2022)  
fond memories of bashing my head trying to get bazel to work :-)  
python ver 3.9  

As this is my first project, the model's performance wasn't particularly good.  Just kinda wanted to get off Kaggle and see what I could do by myself.
Part of the reason for its subpar performance is because of the model but also because of a big lack of data due to
me not knowing how to web scrape at the time and trying to find images manually. Would not recommend 5/10.  

Anyways onto the actual model!  
Due to me not knowing what in the world i was doing back then, this is actually not the whole project.
There are a few other parts such as the programs which organize the data and crop oue the heads and 
randomize the data and whatnot that are here but kinda not here and instead in another adjacent folder that isn't getting pushed.  

The main things are in here though. feel free to poke around and see what nonsense I was doing back then.
